Write your response for a reader with no or very limited CUDA programming background.

Your explanation must be clear, structured, and beginner-friendly.

Requirements:

Avoid assuming prior knowledge of CUDA, GPU architecture, or parallel programming.

When you introduce a technical term, explicitly define it in simple language before using it.

Prefer plain-English explanations over jargon. If jargon is necessary, explain why it exists and what problem it solves.

Use small, concrete examples or analogies (e.g., comparing threads to workers) to explain abstract concepts.

Break the explanation into short sections or bullet points, and explain concepts step-by-step.

If code is included:

Explain what each part does at a high level.

Do not expect the reader to understand CUDA syntax without explanation.

Emphasize intuition first, details second.
